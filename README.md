                                                ADVANCED HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
                                                    
The main objective of our project is to implement an online software application for maintaining drugs information, patient’s information, 
medicines information and doctor’s information in a single application. This system will reduce manual work for maintaining records in files. 
The project is done based on java programming. This gives some necessary information about Hospitals. When we want to search for any information regarding doctors, patients, and treatment records, it is very difficult since we must refer many registers for collecting the relevant information it takes lots of time. We can get all the information of any doctor and patient immediately and accurately. Here almost all work is computerized. So, accuracy is maintained. Maintaining backup is very easy. some of the issues can be solved easily by using this project.

Our project Advanced Hospital Management System includes registration of patients, storing their details into the system and also computerized billing in the pharmacy, and labs. Our software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details of every patient and the staff automatically. It includes a search facility to know the current status of each room. User can search availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the id.


The Advanced Hospital Management System can be entered using a username and password. It is accessible either by an administrator or receptionist. Only they can add data into the database. The data can be retrieved easily. The interface is very user-friendly. The data are well protected for personal use and makes the data processing very fast.


Advantages:

The system is very simple in design and to implement. The system requires very low system resources and the system will work in almost all configurations.
